          Vivienne Turing (38), CEO of NexusAI, was found electrocuted in her smart home server room at 3:47 AM.
          The killer is <span style={{ color: "#ff2d2d" }}>Irene Ashcroft (VP of Product)</span>, who executed a
          meticulously planned murder after Vivienne patented Irene's own AI algorithm, destroying Irene's $50M lawsuit.
          Irene manipulated CTO Basil Whitfield into unwittingly disabling server safety protocols, created a silicone
          fingerprint mold from Vivienne's wine glass to bypass biometrics, planted a camera loop, modified the server
          rack to be lethal, corrupted backups to lure Vivienne, and staged the body. Corporate Counsel{" "}
