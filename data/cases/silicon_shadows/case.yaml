description: Tech CEO Vivienne Turing was found dead in her smart home at 3:47 AM, electrocuted in her biometric-sealed server room. Security logs show no forced entry. Six people had authorized access. The backup files were corrupted at exactly 3:45 AM. One of them is the killer.
context:
  setup: 'The six suspects attended Vivienne''s high-stakes investor dinner party on the evening of the murder, staying overnight at her smart home for the crucial 9 AM Series C presentation worth $200M. Tensions were high — the company''s future depended on this funding. Vivienne''s AI algorithm patent had been officially approved three days earlier, and she planned to announce it at the presentation. What the guests didn''t know: Vivienne had spent the past week quietly building an airtight fraud case against her lead investor, and planned to hand it to federal regulators immediately after the 9 AM close.'
  house_layout: 'Modern two-story smart home. Ground floor: foyer, kitchen, wine cellar, garage (off kitchen). Second floor: hallway (central), master bedroom, 4 guest rooms, home office, server room (all off hallway). All second-floor rooms have biometric access. Travel time between any two second-floor rooms: 30-45 seconds.'
  biometric_secured_rooms:

  timeline_note: All times are based on smart home system logs, which are considered reliable except during the 3:35-3:39 camera loop period.
victim:
  name: Vivienne Turing
  age: 38
  cause: Electrocution (modified server rack, 240V direct contact)
  time_of_death: 3:47 AM (confirmed by smart home power surge log and medical examiner estimate of 3:45-3:50 AM)
  description: Founder and CEO of NexusAI, a controversial AI startup valued at $800M. Known for ruthless IP protection and aggressive acquisition tactics. Her core AI algorithm patent was approved 3 days before her death. In the week before her murder, she had been secretly compiling financial forensics on investor fraud — a file she called 'PROMETHEUS' — and had scheduled a call with the SEC for 10 AM the morning after the Series C closed.
  avatar: avatars/silicon_shadows/vivienne.png
  autopsy_findings:
    cause: Cardiac arrest due to electrocution, 240V AC current
    contact_point: Right hand, palm and fingers, consistent with grasping energized metal surface
    time_of_death: Between 3:45-3:50 AM, most likely 3:47 AM based on power surge log
    instant_death: Yes, death was instantaneous upon contact
    defensive_wounds: None
    toxicology: Negative for drugs, alcohol, or sedatives
    other_findings: Minor contusions on back and left hip consistent with falling backward after electrical shock. Body was then dragged approximately 3 feet forward toward the server rack — inconsistent with an accidental death scenario. Staging attempt detected.

      - name: Drag Marks
        description: 'Scuff patterns in the anti-static flooring tell a clear story: a body fell backward 3 feet from the rack (consistent with electrocution recoil), then was dragged forward. The repositioning was clumsy and powerful — whoever did it was strong enough to move a full-grown adult quickly. The drag direction is consistent with someone approaching from the hallway side door, not the terminal desk.'

Three encrypted message threads visible in the notification preview: ''PROMETHEUS — she has everything'', ''window closes at 9 AM'', and — most damning — ''it has to be tonight. confirm.'' Final outgoing message: 3:02 AM. The phone is registered to a shell company linked to TechVault Partners. The same shell company appears in Vivienne''s PROMETHEUS file.'
      - name: Biometric Entry Log
        description: 'A digital display on the cellar door shows: 03:20 — Marcus Zhao (entry). 03:41 — Marcus Zhao (exit, 21 minutes). 03:44 — Marcus Zhao (re-entry). 03:53 — Marcus Zhao (exit, final). The gap — 03:41 to 03:44 — is three minutes. Enough time to reach the second floor, use an override device, and return. The wine cellar alibi has a hole in it.'

The token is not tied to any named user credential — it requires physical possession of the override hardware key to authenticate.'
    irene_laptop: Irene's laptop in the home office. An automated presentation editing script is visible in the process list — pre-written, triggered at 3:28 AM, making minor file changes every 2-3 minutes to simulate continuous work. The keyboard is cold. Irene built her own false alibi, but internal office motion sensors confirm no movement in the room after 3:28 AM. She did not leave. The script was for protection against suspicion, not cover for an absence.
    fingerprint_mold_kit: 'Professional biometric spoofing kit found in the home office desk drawer (bottom level): silicone molding compound, UV curing lamp, gelatin film strips, and two molds. One complete (right index fingerprint, female — Vivienne Turing). One partial and degraded — used once and discarded. The used mold is too degraded to identify by print, but its size is inconsistent with Irene Ashcroft''s hand dimensions. The kit was Irene''s. The used mold was someone else''s work.'
    biometric_exit_log_gap: 'Wine cellar biometric door log shows: 03:20 Marcus Zhao (entry), 03:41 Marcus Zhao (exit), 03:44 Marcus Zhao (re-entry), 03:53 Marcus Zhao (final exit). The 03:41–03:44 gap — three minutes unaccounted for — is enough time to reach the second floor via the kitchen stairs, use the admin override device on the server room, and return. Marcus''s alibi has a structural hole.'
    vivienne_tablet: 'Vivienne''s tablet, found on the master bedroom pillow. Two apps open: the backup alert notification (opened at 3:45:47 AM) and a secure folder labeled PROMETHEUS, last accessed at 1:52 AM. The folder contains wire transfer records, shell company diagrams, and a draft SEC complaint naming Marcus Zhao. An email to an SEC pre-filing contact was sent from Vivienne''s personal account at 1:47 AM — still in her sent folder.'
    server_rack: 'Main server rack modified: ground wire disconnected, safety interlock disabled, exposed 240V bus bar at chest height. Alex Whitfield accessed bay 12 at 3:15 AM but only performed diagnostics — he did not modify the safety systems. The lethal modification occurred during the 3:37 AM entry, when Marcus used the spoofed fingerprint to access the room and completed the rack modification in approximately 7-9 minutes. He had studied the rack specs — pages of technical documentation were found printed in his briefcase.'
    floor_marks: 'Scuff marks on server room floor: body fell backward 3 feet from the rack (electrocution recoil), then was dragged forward. The drag force and direction indicate someone of significant physical strength approaching from the hallway-side door. Marcus Zhao is 6''2", 210 lbs. The drag arc is consistent with his dominant right arm. Irene Ashcroft was in the home office during this window — her automated script was running, but internal office sensor logs confirm no motion after 3:28 AM in the home office. She did not leave.'
    backup_drive: 'RAID backup array professionally corrupted using military-grade data destruction algorithm. Unrecoverable. Corruption initiated from server room terminal at 3:45 AM using the admin override token. The targeted files: Vivienne''s PROMETHEUS fraud dossier and three months of encrypted correspondence between Vivienne and an SEC pre-filing contact. Marcus Zhao is the subject of the PROMETHEUS file.'
    admin_override_device: Hardware override key (ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CODE_7749) found in server room, under desk. Smudged fingerprints and cleaning residue — same solvent type found in Marcus's jacket pocket (foyer coat rack). Device stored in Vivienne's home office safe. Safe biometric log shows spoofed access at 11:58 PM. The spoofed mold used on the safe scanner is a partial match to Celeste Miller's right index finger — Celeste accessed the safe earlier that evening at Vivienne's request to retrieve a USB drive, and Marcus later used a mold cast from the safe scanner's residue impression to create a workable copy. Celeste was unknowingly used.
    hallway_cam_3_analysis: Camera loop was pre-recorded footage from 3:35-3:39 AM the previous night (same lighting, no people). Loop file was uploaded via a timer-triggered script on Marcus's tablet in guest room 4. The tablet was left in the room; Marcus staged the upload to fire automatically while he was establishing his wine cellar alibi. Home office workstation shows no upload activity — Irene did not trigger the loop.
    prometheus_file: 'Secure document folder on Vivienne''s tablet labeled PROMETHEUS. Contains: wire transfer records showing $50M in Series A/B investor funds routed through TechVault Partners shell companies back to Marcus Zhao personally; a shell company ownership diagram with Marcus''s signature; and a draft SEC complaint dated the day before the murder, scheduled for submission the morning after the Series C closed. Vivienne had planned to secure the $200M, then immediately report Marcus. She had emailed the SEC contact from a personal account at 1:47 AM — the email is in her sent folder.'
    wine_glass_cellar: The wine glass in the cellar was pre-poured before 3:20 AM. Wine temperature analysis places it at room temperature by 3:47 AM, meaning it was poured at least 90 minutes earlier — around 2:10 AM. Marcus set the scene before going upstairs. He planned the alibi, not the insomnia.
    marcus_briefcase: 'Locked briefcase in guest room 4. Behind the lining: printed financial wiring diagrams and shell company structures in Marcus''s handwriting, with annotations: ''before Series C closes, liability transfers'' and ''PROMETHEUS — if she files, everything collapses.'' A separate note reads: ''Alex handles Bay 12 at 3:15. Room clear by 3:20. Window: 3:35-3:42.'' Marcus planned around Alex''s scheduled access.'
    burner_phone_found: 'Burner phone found hidden behind wine rack in cellar. Registered to a TechVault Partners shell company — the same company named throughout Vivienne''s PROMETHEUS file. Three message threads: ''PROMETHEUS — she has everything'', ''window closes at 9 AM'', and ''it has to be tonight. confirm.'' Final outgoing message sent at 3:02 AM. The recipient''s encrypted contact traces to an IP registered to Marcus''s private legal counsel in Geneva.'
    burner_phone_decrypt: 'Full decryption reveals Marcus coordinating with his Geneva attorney on a cover-up strategy. ''PROMETHEUS — she has everything'' refers to Vivienne''s fraud dossier, which Marcus learned about three days earlier when TechVault''s compliance team intercepted a test-query Vivienne sent to a third-party forensics firm. ''Window closes at 9 AM'' is the Series C signing — once closed, Vivienne would have had standing to file immediately. The final thread, ''it has to be tonight,'' is instructions to his counsel to begin asset liquidation the moment Marcus confirmed the problem was ''resolved.'' His counsel replied: ''understood. confirm when done.'' Marcus replied at 3:02 AM: ''proceeding.'' The murder was premeditated and communicated.'
    silicone_glove: 'A single lab-grade silicone glove found near the garage floor drain, turned inside-out. Interior: still damp, thermal curing compound residue consistent with biometric casting material. The glove''s size is consistent with a large male hand — significantly larger than Irene Ashcroft''s hands. Cross-reference with admin override device residue and the biometric spoofing kit in the home office: Marcus accessed the spoofing kit from the home office (where Celeste''s DNA also appears), created a working mold using the residue impression from the safe scanner, and used it once to access the server room at 3:37 AM.'
    alex_phone: 'Text message from Marcus to Alex at 11:52 PM: ''The rack in Bay 12 needs the ground wire checked before tomorrow — Vivienne asked me to pass it along, she didn''t want to bother you directly. Routine. Can you handle it around 3 AM?'' Alex: ''Sure. Done by 3:20.'' Alex performed diagnostics and a routine continuity check — he did not disable the ground wire. Marcus''s plan required Alex to be in the server room to establish a reason for Alex''s fingerprints and biometric access on the logs, muddying the trail. Alex was used as misdirection.'
    celeste_server_access: 'Celeste Miller accessed the server room at 3:18 AM under her emergency co-admin credential, which she did not mention in her statement. She entered for 60 seconds and exited. When confronted: she was checking whether Vivienne had copied the PROMETHEUS file to a redundant offsite server she knew existed — she wanted to warn Marcus if so. She did not find it. She is not the killer but she knew about the PROMETHEUS file and chose to protect Marcus rather than Vivienne.'
    irene_notebook: 'Composition notebook found in Irene''s guest room desk drawer behind a false bottom. Dense algorithm derivations in Irene''s handwriting, dated 8-16 months ago — the development record of the NexusAI core algorithm, predating Vivienne''s filings by six months. Post-it note inside cover: ''I was there. I will always know.'' Irene had motive for murder. She did not commit it tonight — but she knew something was wrong in this house, and she chose to build an automated alibi just in case she needed one. She is protecting herself from a crime she didn''t commit, which makes her look exactly like she did.'
    priya_note: 'Handwritten note on NexusAI letterhead found folded on the second floor hallway side table. Timestamped 1:17 AM, in Priya''s handwriting: ''M — I reviewed the Series A wire records. I know what you built. I know what she built against you. Whatever you''re planning — I won''t be awake at 3 AM. —P.'' At first glance it reads like a cryptic professional aside. Its significance only surfaces when investigators understand ''M'' is Marcus, not Irene — and that Priya, as corporate counsel, had seen the acquisition documents and identified the Ponzi structure independently. She chose silence. She will not break.'
    server_audit_trail: Server system audit log shows a deleted incident report from 6 months ago — unauthorized access of a restricted directory by Devon Marsh's credentials. The incident report was reviewed and manually deleted by Irene Ashcroft before escalation. Irene protected Devon. Devon knows. Devon has not said what they saw on those stairs at 3:38 AM — and Irene's protection of Devon six months ago is the weight keeping Devon quiet.

    alex: I was asked to check the ground wire in Bay 12 at 3:15 AM. Marcus said Vivienne passed along the request. In and out in four minutes. Routine diagnostics. Went back to sleep. Woke up to screaming.
    irene: I was working on the investor presentation in the home office from 3:28 AM until Devon started screaming. I have edit logs proving continuous work. I didn't leave the office.
    devon: I had insomnia, made chamomile tea around 3:25. I went upstairs briefly around 3:38 — I thought I'd left my phone at the hallway charger. I didn't see anyone. I was back in the kitchen when the lights flickered. I ran upstairs and found Vivienne. I called 911 immediately.
    celeste: I was asleep in the master bedroom. Vivienne and I went to bed around 1 AM. I didn't hear anything until the emergency alerts started going off.
    priya: I was exhausted from the flight and took an Ambien at 11 PM. I slept through everything until police knocked on my door.
    marcus: I have terrible insomnia before high-stakes meetings. I went to the wine cellar around 3:20 to open a Château Margaux I'd been eyeing. I was there when the power flickered. The cellar has poor reception — I didn't hear alerts until I came upstairs.

  accomplice: alex
  accomplice_knowledge: none - unwitting accomplice. Marcus used Alex exactly as Irene used Alex in the previous version — manipulating a technically capable, morally earnest person into creating the conditions for murder without knowing it.
  silent_witness: priya
  silent_witness_knowledge: Priya independently identified Marcus's financial fraud while reviewing the acquisition documents. She sent Marcus a warning note at 1:17 AM and took her Ambien. She suspected what was coming. She chose silence, reasoning that Vivienne's death was no longer her responsibility once she went to sleep. She will cite legal ethics and personal liability if pressed. She will never admit what 'whatever you're planning' in the note actually meant.
  misdirection_suspect: irene
  misdirection_knowledge: Irene had every reason to kill Vivienne — stolen algorithm, crushed lawsuit, stolen credit. She built a fake alibi script. She kept the spoofing kit in the home office. She has the notebook. Everything about Irene screams guilt. But she did not act tonight. She spent the evening watching, building legal cover, and waiting for a different moment. Marcus committed the murder Irene had been planning, before Irene could do it. She suspects this. She will not say so.
  method: Marcus learned Vivienne had compiled the PROMETHEUS fraud file three days earlier (same day the patent was approved) through his TechVault compliance contact intercepting a Vivienne query to a forensics firm. He spent three days planning. At dinner, he observed Alex being assigned technical tasks and identified him as useful misdirection. At 11:52 PM he texted Alex with fabricated maintenance instructions. He studied the home office spoofing kit — already present because Irene had placed it there for her own purposes — and used the residue from Celeste's safe scanner touch to construct a rough working mold capable of a single use. At 2:10 AM he pre-poured his alibi wine glass. At 3:02 AM he sent final confirmation to his Geneva counsel. He uploaded a timer-triggered camera loop from his tablet at a preset time. At 3:20 AM he entered the wine cellar to begin establishing his alibi. At 3:37 AM he exited, went upstairs, used the spoofed mold to enter the server room, and spent 7-9 minutes completing the lethal rack modification. He returned to the wine cellar at 3:41, re-exited at 3:44 to use the admin override device to execute backup destruction and wipe the PROMETHEUS files, then returned to the cellar at 3:44. The backup alert lured Vivienne at 3:46. She died at 3:47. Between 3:47 and 3:49 Marcus exited the cellar a third time (not logged — he propped the door), staged the body, and returned. Devon saw a large figure on the stairs at 3:42 — not Irene, as in the original case. Devon said nothing because Irene had once protected them, and Devon wrongly assumed the figure was Irene.
  motive: Marcus had fraudulently routed $50M of investor funds through shell companies back to himself across the Series A and B rounds — a Ponzi structure that would collapse the moment anyone looked carefully at the books. Vivienne had looked carefully. She had spent weeks building an airtight forensic case (PROMETHEUS) and planned to hand it to the SEC the morning after the Series C closed, giving her the moral high ground and maximum financial cushion. Marcus faced federal criminal exposure, total asset forfeiture, and prison. Killing Vivienne and destroying the PROMETHEUS files was his only viable exit before 9 AM.
  twist: 'The note Priya left reads ''M — whatever you''re planning — I won''t be awake at 3 AM.'' Investigators initially assume ''M'' is Irene (Irene''s middle name begins with E, but Priya uses professional initials casually). The twist: ''M'' is Marcus. Priya had identified his fraud pattern in the acquisition documents, realized he was dangerous, and chose to warn him she would not be a witness — effectively clearing the room. When confronted, Priya''s defense is legally precise and personally devastating: ''I wrote a note to a person I suspected might do something rash. I did not tell him to do anything. I took a prescription sleeping pill. I was not present. I am a lawyer, and I know exactly what I did not do.'' She is correct. She will never be charged. Players must decide what to do with her.'
  irene_twist: If investigators push hard on Irene, she eventually says — icily — 'I had planned to act. I had the kit, the access, the reason. But someone moved faster than me, and destroyed the evidence I needed to clear my own name in the process. Whoever killed Vivienne also destroyed the emails that proved she stole my algorithm. They didn't just kill her. They finished me.' She is telling the truth. Marcus's backup wipe destroyed Irene's best evidence in her civil suit. Marcus, in saving himself, also accidentally finished Irene's last hope of justice.
  timeline_summary:
    Three days before (patent approval day): Marcus learns Vivienne has compiled the PROMETHEUS fraud file. Begins planning.
    Dinner party (evening): Marcus observes Alex, identifies him as useful misdirection. Studies Irene's spoofing kit in the home office. Vivienne's wine glass gives him Celeste's fingerprint impression on the safe scanner — enough for a rough working mold.
    02:10 AM: Marcus pre-pours his alibi wine glass in the cellar. Sets up his tablet in guest room 4 with a timer-triggered camera loop script.
    03:02 AM: 'Marcus sends final confirmation message to Geneva counsel on burner phone: ''proceeding.'''
    03:15 AM: Alex enters server room on Marcus's manufactured request — establishes Alex's legitimate biometric access on the logs.
    03:20 AM: Marcus enters wine cellar — begins alibi construction.
    03:28 AM: Irene enters home office, starts her own automated alibi script (for reasons unrelated to Marcus's plan).
    03:34:58 AM: Timer script on Marcus's pre-staged tablet uploads camera loop to hallway cam 3.
    03:35 AM: Camera loop begins — hallway cam 3 blind.
    03:37 AM: Marcus exits wine cellar and goes upstairs. Uses spoofed fingerprint to enter server room. Completes lethal rack modification (~7-9 minutes).
    03:41 AM: Marcus returns to wine cellar.
    03:42 AM: Devon sees large figure on stairs — assumes it is Irene due to loyalty debt. Says nothing to police.
    03:44 AM: Marcus exits wine cellar again. Uses admin override device to re-enter server room, executes backup destruction targeting PROMETHEUS files.
    03:44 AM (second entry): Marcus returns to wine cellar.
    03:45 AM: Backup corruption triggers alert to Vivienne's tablet.
    03:46 AM: Vivienne receives alert, goes to server room.
    03:47 AM: Vivienne touches electrified rack. Dies instantly.
    03:47-03:49 AM: Marcus exits cellar via propped door (no log), stages body by dragging Vivienne toward rack, returns to cellar.
    03:50 AM: Devon arrives at second floor hallway.
    03:51 AM: Devon enters server room, finds Vivienne, calls 911.
    03:53 AM: Marcus exits wine cellar via official biometric log — establishing his clean exit after the fact.

    alibi: I was in the home office working on the investor presentation from 3:28 AM until Devon started screaming. I have the edit logs. I did not leave that room.
    motive: Created NexusAI's core algorithm but Vivienne patented it under her own name. Six months ago, Vivienne gave a keynote to 800 investors and publicly thanked Irene for 'helping test early prototypes' — while Irene sat in the front row and applauded on cue. The patent was approved 3 days before the murder. The 9 AM presentation would have announced it publicly, destroying Irene's legal case forever. She had every reason. She did not act. But she can't easily explain why she built a fake alibi if she has nothing to hide.

    tells: 'Goes very quiet — not thoughtful, processing — when he''s calculating damage. Knuckles whiten on any surface he''s touching when the evidence is close to complete. The one crack: a very brief eye-close when the full chain is laid in front of him.'
