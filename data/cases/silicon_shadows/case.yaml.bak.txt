description: Tech CEO Vivienne Turing was found dead in her smart home at 3:47 AM, electrocuted in her biometric-sealed server room. Security logs show no forced entry. Six people had authorized access. The backup files were corrupted at exactly 3:45 AM. One of them is the killer.
context:
  setup: The six suspects attended Vivienne's high-stakes investor dinner party on the evening of the murder, staying overnight at her smart home for the crucial 9 AM Series C presentation worth $200M. Tensions were high—the company's future depended on this funding. Vivienne's AI algorithm patent had been officially approved three days earlier, and she planned to announce it at the presentation.
  house_layout: 'Modern two-story smart home. Ground floor: foyer, kitchen, wine cellar, garage (off kitchen). Second floor: hallway (central), master bedroom, 4 guest rooms, home office, server room (all off hallway). All second-floor rooms have biometric access. Travel time between any two second-floor rooms: 30-45 seconds.'

victim:
  name: Vivienne Turing
  age: 38
  cause: Electrocution (modified server rack, 240V direct contact)
  time_of_death: 3:47 AM (confirmed by smart home power surge log and medical examiner estimate of 3:45-3:50 AM)
  description: Founder and CEO of NexusAI, a controversial AI startup valued at $800M. Known for ruthless IP protection and aggressive acquisition tactics. Her core AI algorithm patent was approved 3 days before her death.
  avatar: avatars/silicon_shadows/vivienne.png
  autopsy_findings:
    cause: Cardiac arrest due to electrocution, 240V AC current
    contact_point: Right hand, palm and fingers, consistent with grasping energized metal surface
    time_of_death: Between 3:45-3:50 AM, most likely 3:47 AM based on power surge log
    instant_death: Yes, death was instantaneous upon contact
    defensive_wounds: None
    toxicology: Negative for drugs, alcohol, or sedatives
    other_findings: Minor contusions on back and left hip consistent with falling backward after electrical shock. Body was then dragged approximately 3 feet forward toward the server rack — inconsistent with an accidental death scenario. Staging attempt detected.

    server_rack: 'Main server rack modified: ground wire disconnected, safety interlock disabled, exposed 240V bus bar at chest height. Safety protocols had been disabled earlier by Alex Whitfield at 3:15 AM (reducing full modification to approximately 5-7 minutes of targeted work). Fresh tool marks on safety cover screws.'
    floor_marks: 'Scuff marks on server room floor indicate body fell backward 3 feet from the rack (consistent with electrocution recoil), then was dragged forward back toward the rack. This is inconsistent with an accidental death — a person who died touching the rack would not be found repositioned unless moved. The staging was clumsy: Irene attempted to reposition Vivienne closer to the rack to imply she was working on it, but miscalculated the fall distance. The drag marks are the clearest indicator of foul play in the entire scene.'
    backup_drive: RAID backup array professionally corrupted using military-grade data destruction algorithm. Unrecoverable. Corruption initiated from server room terminal at 3:45 AM using Irene Ashcroft's admin credentials.
    admin_override_device: 'Hardware override key (device ID: ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CODE_7749) found in server room, under desk. Smudged fingerprints and cleaning residue detected. Device normally stored in Vivienne''s home office safe. Silicone residue matching fingerprint molding compound found on the safe''s biometric scanner — consistent with the spoofing kit found in the home office desk drawer. Safe access log shows biometric entry at 11:58 PM the night of the dinner party, prior to any guest retiring — Irene spoofed Vivienne''s fingerprint to steal the device during the dinner.'
    hallway_cam_3_analysis: Camera loop was pre-recorded footage from 3:35-3:39 AM the previous night (same lighting, no people). Loop file uploaded to camera at 3:34:58 AM from home office workstation.
    wine_glass: Wine glass found in home office trash with Vivienne's lipstick print and saliva. Silicone residue detected on rim - consistent with fingerprint molding compound.
    fingerprint_mold_kit: Professional biometric spoofing kit found hidden in home office desk drawer, bottom level. Contains silicone molding compound, UV curing lamp, and gelatin film. Fresh silicone mold of fingerprint (matches Vivienne's right index finger). A second mold — partial and degraded — appears to have been used and discarded. Kit was present in drawer during the dinner party.
    vivienne_tablet: 'Vivienne''s tablet in master bedroom shows she received backup corruption alert at 3:45 AM. Last activity: opened alert at 3:45:47 AM, then biometric access to server room at 3:46 AM.'
    irene_laptop: Irene's laptop in home office shows automated presentation editing script running from 3:28-3:55 AM, creating false alibi of continuous work. Script made minor edits every 2-3 minutes to create realistic edit log timestamps. Irene was physically absent from the office 3:35-3:42 (server room modification) and again 3:44-3:46 (backup corruption). Script was pre-written and triggered remotely — Irene did not need to be present at the laptop for it to run.
    alex_phone: 'Text message from Irene to Alex at 11:47 PM previous night: ''Vivienne wants server safety protocols disabled for emergency firmware upgrade tonight. She''ll confirm in morning. Can you handle it around 3 AM? She doesn''t want to wake everyone.'' Alex replied: ''Seems odd but ok, will do.'''
    server_room_terminal: 'Terminal shows backup corruption command executed at 3:45 AM. Login: Irene Ashcroft''s credentials. Terminal physically accessed (not remote). Access aligns with second use of admin override device at 3:44 AM.'
    safe_access_log: Home office safe biometric log shows single access at 11:58 PM (dinner party, before guests retired). No authorized user claimed to access the safe that evening. Silicone residue on safe scanner confirms spoofed fingerprint entry. Admin override device was stolen at this time.
    marcus_burner_phone: 'Burner phone found hidden behind a wine rack in the wine cellar. Contains encrypted messages with contact labeled BROKER. Visible unencrypted metadata shows three message threads: subject lines ''the algorithm valuation'', ''resolving the IP conflict before 9 AM'', and — most troubling — ''once she''s gone, timeline moves up.'' Final message sent at 2:58 AM. Phone registered to a shell company. The full content of all three threads is encrypted.'
    marcus_burner_phone_decrypt: Full decryption of burner phone messages reveals Marcus was negotiating a private acquisition of NexusAI's algorithm licensing rights from TechVault Partners to recoup his $50M losses — entirely unrelated to the murder. 'Resolving the IP conflict' was a licensing arbitration. The 9 AM deadline was his own acquisition window before the Series C announcement changed valuations. The disturbing thread — 'once she's gone, timeline moves up' — refers to Vivienne's planned retirement after the Series C close, which Marcus had been told about in a confidential board memo. He was timing a deal around her departure from day-to-day management. The language is cold. The intent was legal. He genuinely did not know she would be dead.
    server_audit_trail: Server system audit log shows a deleted incident report from 6 months ago — unauthorized access of a restricted directory by Devon Marsh's credentials. The incident report was reviewed and manually deleted by Irene Ashcroft before escalation. Deletion was within Irene's admin permissions and no disciplinary action was taken. The original flag still exists in the raw system log.
    irene_notebook: 'Composition notebook found wedged behind a false bottom in Irene''s guest room desk drawer — the room she stayed in before moving to the home office. Pages dated 8-16 months ago, dense with algorithm derivations in Irene''s handwriting. Not a journal. Working notes. The actual development record of the NexusAI core algorithm, in her hand, predating any of Vivienne''s filings by six months. Irene kept it. She couldn''t throw it away. Post-it note stuck to the inside cover, in Irene''s writing: ''I was there. I will always know.'' It is not evidence of murder. It is evidence of why.'
    priya_note: 'Handwritten note on NexusAI letterhead found folded on the second floor hallway side table — left there by Irene after reading it. Time-stamped 1:17 AM in Priya''s handwriting: ''E — I saw what''s in the desk. I understand why. I won''t be awake at 3 AM. —P'' At first glance it reads like a professional aside between colleagues — perhaps about the acquisition documents, or a late-night conversation between lawyers. Its significance only becomes apparent once investigators know what was in the desk and what happened at 3 AM. Priya has said nothing about it.'
    silicone_glove: A single lab-grade silicone glove found near the garage floor drain, turned inside-out. The interior is still damp. Chemical analysis reveals traces of thermal curing compound — the same compound used in professional biometric casting. The glove's size is consistent with a female hand. Whoever used this was handling fingerprint molding materials and discarded the glove where the garage camera couldn't see. Cross-reference with the fingerprint mold kit found in the home office.

    alex: I was asked to do routine server maintenance at 3:15 AM. In and out in four minutes. Went back to sleep. Woke up to screaming.
    irene: I was working on the investor presentation in the home office from 3:28 until Devon started screaming. I have edit logs proving I was working the entire time.
    devon: I had insomnia, made tea around 3:25. I went upstairs briefly around 3:38 to grab my phone from the hallway charger. I didn't see anyone. I was back in the kitchen when the lights flickered. I ran upstairs and found Vivienne. I called 911 immediately.
    celeste: I was asleep in the master bedroom. Vivienne and I went to bed around 1 AM. I didn't hear anything until the emergency alerts started going off.
    priya: I was asleep in guest room 3. I'm a heavy sleeper - I slept through everything until people were shouting in the hallway.
    marcus: I have insomnia and rare wine helps me sleep. I went to the wine cellar around 3:20 to select a bottle. I was there when the power flickered.

  silent_witness_knowledge: Priya discovered Irene's spoofing kit in the home office desk drawer during the dinner party when she used the office to review documents. She deduced Irene's intent, wrote a note signaling she would not intervene, and took her Ambien. She is not legally guilty of murder but knowingly allowed it to proceed. She will never volunteer this information.
  method: Irene manipulated Alex into disabling server safety protocols under false pretense of emergency firmware upgrade (text sent 11:47 PM). She created a fingerprint mold from Vivienne's wine glass during dinner. At 11:58 PM she used the spoofed fingerprint to access Vivienne's home office safe and steal the admin override device. At 3:28 AM she entered the home office and started an automated alibi script. At 3:34:58 AM she uploaded a pre-recorded camera loop to hallway cam 3 from the office workstation. At 3:37 AM she entered the server room using the spoofed fingerprint and modified the server rack to be lethal — approximately 5-7 minutes of targeted work, possible because Alex had already disabled the safety protocols. At 3:40 AM she briefly tested the stolen admin override device. She returned to the home office at 3:42 AM. At 3:44 AM she used the override to re-enter and at 3:45 AM corrupted the backups from the server terminal using her own credentials — knowing the alert would lure Vivienne. She returned to the home office at 3:46 AM. When Vivienne arrived at 3:46 and touched the electrified rack at 3:47 AM, she was killed instantly. Between 3:47 and 3:49 AM Irene returned to the server room, staged the body by dragging Vivienne toward the rack, then retreated to the home office before Devon arrived at 3:50 AM.
  motive: Vivienne stole Irene's core AI algorithm and patented it under her own name. Six months ago, Vivienne gave a keynote to 800 investors and publicly thanked Irene for 'helping test early prototypes' — while Irene sat in the front row and applauded. The patent was officially approved 3 days before the murder. The 9 AM investor presentation would announce it publicly, destroying Irene's legal case forever and erasing her from her own work. The $50M mattered. But the keynote was what broke her.
  twist: 'Priya Sharma, corporate counsel, discovered the fingerprint mold kit in the home office desk drawer during the dinner party while reviewing documents. She recognized its purpose and, knowing Vivienne''s history of blackmail, fraud, and IP theft — and knowing Irene''s devastating situation — chose to say nothing. She wrote Irene a note at 1:17 AM, took her Ambien, and went to bed. The note is found early in the investigation on the hallway side table — at first it reads like nothing, a professional aside between colleagues. Its horror only surfaces once investigators understand what ''what''s in the desk'' means and what happened at 3 AM. Priya will never volunteer what the note means. When confronted directly, she is ice-cold: ''I''m a lawyer. I know exactly what I did and didn''t do. I took a sleeping pill and went to bed. What happens while you''re asleep isn''t your responsibility.'' She will not break. Players must decide what to do with her.'
  timeline_summary:
    Dinner party (evening): Irene takes Vivienne's wine glass and creates a fingerprint mold using her spoofing kit. Priya borrows the home office to review documents and discovers the kit in the desk drawer.
    11:47 PM: Irene texts Alex pretending to relay Vivienne's firmware upgrade request.
    11:58 PM: Irene uses spoofed fingerprint to access Vivienne's home office safe and steals the admin override device (ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CODE_7749).
    01:17 AM: 'Priya writes a note to Irene: ''E — I saw what''s in the desk. I understand why. I won''t be awake at 3 AM. —P'' She slips it under guest room 1. Irene reads it, brings it to the home office.'
    03:15 AM: Alex disables server safety protocols as 'requested'.
    03:28 AM: Irene enters home office, starts automated editing script for false alibi.
    03:34:58 AM: Irene uploads pre-recorded camera loop to hallway cam 3 from home office workstation.
    03:35 AM: Camera loop begins — hallway cam 3 blind.
    03:37 AM: Irene enters server room using spoofed fingerprint mold (Vivienne's fingerprint). Modifies server rack to be lethal (~5-7 minutes, possible because Alex already disabled safety protocols).
    03:40 AM: Irene briefly tests admin override device — brief entry, no additional work done.
    03:42 AM: Irene exits server room, returns to home office.
    03:44 AM: Irene uses admin override to re-enter server room.
    03:45 AM: Irene accesses server terminal with her own credentials, corrupts backups (destroys evidence emails, triggers alert to lure Vivienne).
    03:46 AM: Vivienne receives alert, goes to server room. Irene exits server room and returns to home office.
    03:47 AM: Vivienne touches electrified rack, dies instantly.
    03:47-03:49 AM: Irene returns to server room, stages body — drags Vivienne toward rack. Returns to home office by 03:49 AM.
    03:50 AM: Devon arrives at second floor hallway.
    03:51 AM: Devon enters server room, finds Vivienne, immediately exits.

    isGuilty: false
    alibi: I have chronic insomnia. I went to the kitchen around 3:25 to make chamomile tea. I went upstairs briefly around 3:38 to grab my phone — I'd left it in the hallway charging — then came back down to the kitchen. I was steeping tea when the lights flickered at 3:47. I ran upstairs and found Vivienne. I called 911 immediately.
    motive: Vivienne rejected Devon's accessibility-focused redesign to cut costs, calling it 'wasted effort on edge cases.' Devon saw this as discrimination against disabled users and felt morally devastated. Six months ago, Devon was caught accessing a restricted server folder without authorization — a mistake, not malice. Irene quietly buried the incident report before it reached Vivienne. Devon has never forgotten that.
