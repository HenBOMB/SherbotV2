  text: This analysis confirms the footage was replaced with a pre-recorded clip. Cross-reference with the **Digital Logs at 03:34:58** — the upload came from Guest Room 4's workstation tablet, not the Home Office.

  text: If she fell backward from the shock, why is her body 3 feet closer to the rack now? Someone repositioned her after the surge. The drag force suggests a person of significant physical strength. This was staged.

  text: The editing script runs on a timer, making changes every 2-3 minutes automatically — Irene built her own fake alibi. But internal sensor logs show no motion in the Home Office after 3:28 AM. Her alibi is manufactured, but her location is confirmed. Someone else was moving.

  text: Marcus exited the wine cellar at 03:41 and re-entered at 03:44 — a three-minute gap he can't account for. The server room is 30-45 seconds from the cellar. That gap is enough time to reach the second floor, use an override device, and return.
