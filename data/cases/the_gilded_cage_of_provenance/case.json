Rain slicked the cobblestones outside, mirroring the sheen on the victim's fallen form near a toppled display case.  Eleanor Beaumont, queen of acquisitions, lay dead, and the silent witnesses were all exquisitely framed, waiting to be interviewed.",

        "description": "A man whose charm was as meticulously curated as the art he peddled, Silas Redwood possessed a rare talent for making everyone feel like the most important person in the room, until they weren't. He saw people as acquisitions, collecting favors and grudges with equal fervor, a trait that made him a formidable patron but a treacherous business partner. Beneath the polished veneer, however, lay a sharp eye for emerging talent and a surprising, almost paternal, generosity towards those he deemed truly deserving of a leg up, a memory that would haunt his empty gallery.",

The camera captures him from an angle that emphasizes his isolation in the cavernous space. He seems to be examining something on his tablet, oblivious to the surrounding darkness.",
            "22:07": "The Restoration Studio camera shows Anya still agitated, now aggressively sketching in a tattered notebook. Her hand moves like a frantic spider, lines bleeding into one another. The camera catches the briefest glimpse of her face; her eyes are wide, unfocused, staring at something beyond the frame.",
            "22:15": "The Street camera captures Anya emerging from the gallery's side entrance, onto the dimly lit sidewalk. She clutches her notebook to her chest, her gait hurried. She glances up and down the empty street, a fleeting expression of desperation on her face before she melts into the shadows.",
            "22:22": "The Storage Vault camera sees Silas, the Restorer, moving through the aisles. He's carrying a small, dark object. He stops by a row of old chests, his back to the camera, and seems to be placing the object inside. The camera's low resolution makes it impossible to identify the item.",
            "22:28": "The Restoration Studio camera shows Julian, the Critic, standing near Anya's easel, a look of disdain on his face. He gestures dismissively, as if dismantling her work with words. Anya stands rigid, her back to him, her shoulders tight with tension. The camera is angled too low to capture their full expressions clearly.",
            "22:32": "The Private Office camera, usually showing Thorne's meticulously organized desk, now captures Mr. Sterling, the Collector, rifling through papers. He’s not overtly destructive, but his movements are acquisitive, searching. He pauses, looking directly at the camera for a beat, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips, before returning to his task.",
            "22:36": "The Storage Vault camera shows Silas again, this time retrieving something from the same row of chests he visited earlier. He moves quickly, the object now concealed in his coat pocket. He casts a nervous glance toward the camera before exiting the frame.",
            "22:48": "The Main Gallery camera shows Silas returning. He walks with a more determined pace this time, directly towards the gallery's street-facing entrance. The dim lighting casts long, wavering shadows, making his form appear gaunt and spectral. He doesn't seem to notice the camera.",
            "22:51": "The Street camera catches Mr. Thorne emerging from the gallery's main doors. He appears agitated, looking around as if expecting someone. The flickering streetlamp illuminates his face, etched with a sudden worry, before he steps further out onto the sidewalk, his back to the camera.",
            "22:54": "The Street camera feed for this exact moment is a wash of static, a brief, violent burst of visual noise that lasts for nearly ten seconds. When the image clears, the street is empty. The streetlamp, however, casts an unusual, elongated shadow that seems to have appeared from nowhere.",
            "22:57": "The Main Gallery camera shows Silas re-entering, moving with a controlled urgency that belies his earlier stillness. He doesn't look back as he exits the frame into the darkened hallway leading to the back offices. There's a subtle, dark smudge on the sleeve of his jacket, almost invisible in the gloom."
