  Chief Appraiser Elias Thorne was found dead inside Vault B of the Aethelgard Auction House at 10:55 PM during the Winter VIP Gala. 
  The vault's Halon fire-suppression system triggered at 10:45 PM, instantly purging all oxygen from the sealed room. 
  The security cameras were manually disabled, the vault was locked from the outside, and the Director was on stage giving a toast to 200 people when the alarms rang.
context:
  setup: >
    The Aethelgard Auction House is hosting its most lucrative event of the decade, featuring the sale of a recently discovered Renaissance masterpiece expected to fetch $80 million. 
    The ground floor is a lavish ballroom filled with billionaires; the basement is a high-tech fortress of climate-controlled vaults and security checkpoints. 
    Elias Thorne, a legendary and uncompromising appraiser, went down to the vaults at 10:30 PM to verify a final piece. 
    Twenty-five minutes later, he was dead.

  halon_system_rules: 'CRITICAL MECHANICS: The Halon fire-suppression system is designed to save priceless art by instantly sucking oxygen out of the room and replacing it with Halon gas, extinguishing any flame. However, for the Halon to deploy, TWO conditions must be met simultaneously: 1) The ceiling smoke detectors must detect particulate matter, AND 2) The heavy steel vault door must be physically locked from the outside (which seals the room airtight). If smoke is detected while the door is open, regular alarms sound but the gas does NOT deploy.'

    clara: I... I was in the basement. Julian texted me to close the vault door. I just spun the wheel and came right back up! I didn't know Elias was still inside! You have to believe me, I didn't know!
    marcus: I was in the ballroom drinking champagne. The auction doesn't start until tomorrow, I was just here to socialize. I have no idea why my VIP badge registered in the stairwell, someone must have cloned it.
    anya: I was in the security office. The camera systems have been glitching all week, the loop mode engaged itself due to a software error. When the Halon alarm went off, I followed protocol and called the fire department.
    leo: I argued with my uncle earlier, yes. He was threatening to cut me out of the will. I went down to the basement at 10:28 to cool off in the staff breakroom. I never went near the vault.

  accomplice: clara
  accomplice_knowledge: none - completely unwitting. She believed she was just securing an empty room.
  silent_witness: anya
  silent_witness_knowledge: Anya took a bribe from Marcus to blind the cameras. She knows Marcus was in the hallway, but she doesn't know who killed Elias. She is lying about the cameras glitching to save herself from accessory charges.
  method: Julian Vance was embezzling millions using fake art provenances. Elias discovered this and put the evidence inside a tapestry tube in Vault B. Knowing Elias would go to Vault B at 10:30 PM to inspect it, Julian enacted a perfect locked-room trap. At 9:05 PM, Julian placed a theatrical smoke pellet coated in a 100-minute time-release restoration gel inside the tapestry tube. Because the Halon system requires the door to be sealed to arm, Julian needed the door closed after Elias entered, but couldn't do it himself without leaving a digital footprint. At 10:40 PM, while in the ballroom, he texted Clara to close the vault, knowing Elias was inside. Clara closed it at 10:42 PM, trapping Elias and arming the system. At 10:45 PM, the gel dissolved, the pellet smoked, and the Halon deployed, suffocating Elias while Julian was highly visible on stage. Anya turning off the cameras at 10:35 PM for Marcus's break-in was purely coincidental, but brilliantly served to obfuscate Julian's mechanical trap.
  motive: Elias was going to the police the next morning with the shadow ledger proving Julian was laundering money for an offshore syndicate. If exposed, Julian wouldn't just go to prison—the syndicate would kill him.
  twist: "The entire camera blackout and hallway infiltration had nothing to do with the murder. Marcus Sterling was blackmailing Julian, and paid Anya $50,000 to turn off the cameras at 10:35 PM so Marcus could break into Julian's office and steal the blackmail files. Julian had no idea the cameras were off. Julian's murder plot relied entirely on chemical timing and manipulating Clara via text message. The presence of Marcus sneaking around the basement at the exact time of the murder is a massive, highly suspicious coincidence that hides the elegant simplicity of the real crime."
