    "description": "I’ve been sitting here in the gallery since five a.m., the rain tapping soft on the windows. The light is low, golden, like it’s just waking up. The victim, Mr. Ellington, was found slumped over the grand marble table, his face still turned toward the glass. The trophy—his old college one—was right where he’d been holding it. Now it’s half-buried in the dust, the stem cracked, the gold dimmed. I don’t know who took it, or why, but I know one thing: someone wanted to remember the past, and someone just wanted to erase it.",

        "description": "Elena Marquez, a seasoned art curator in her late 40s, carries the quiet intensity of a woman who has seen the ebb and flow of the art world's rhythms. With a sharp gaze and a penchant for vintage novels, she moves through the city like a shadow, always on the hunt for meaning beneath the surface. A devoted daughter to a working-class family, she balanced her ambition with the quiet grace of a woman who never wanted to be the center of attention. Her life was one of subtle contrasts—elegant yet grounded, emotionally reserved yet deeply empathetic. Known for her uncanny ability to sense the mood in a room, Elena was not just a curator but a storyteller of art, weaving narratives that brought forgotten masterpieces to life. When she was found dead in her apartment, the crime scene suggested a sudden, violent interruption of her routine—her life, it seemed, had been upended just as she was about to present a new exhibit on the forgotten stories of noir artists.",
